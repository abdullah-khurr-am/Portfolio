# Portfolio

> This is my portfolio, you can find in here all my best recent works. The website was designed in ReactJS.

This website was designed with the tools below:

## Built With

- React
- SASS

## Available Scripts

## `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Linters

To track css linter errors you can run the following command at the root of your project if you have NPM installed on your computer.
